# CONCRETE-STRENGTH-PREDICTION-MODEL
The data contains various material compositions used in concrete mixtures and their corresponding compressive strength. The goal is to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and curing time.This can help civil engineers and construction companies optimize concrete mixtures for better durability and cost efficiency.
