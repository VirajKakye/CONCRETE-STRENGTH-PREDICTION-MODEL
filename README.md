# CONCRETE-STRENGTH-PREDICTION-MODEL
The data contains various material compositions used in concrete mixtures and their corresponding compressive strength. The goal is to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and curing time.This can help civil engineers and construction companies optimize concrete mixtures for better durability and cost efficiency.
1. cement (kg/m³) :- Amount of cement used in the concrete mix. A key binding material.
2. blast_furnace_slag (kg/m³) :- A byproduct of steel production, used as a substitute for cement to improve strength.
3. fly_ash (kg/m³) :- A waste material from coal combustion, improves durability and workability.
4. water (kg/m³) :- The amount of water in the mix, which affects workability and strength.
5. superplasticizer (kg/m³) :- Chemical additives that increase fluidity without affecting strength.
6. coarse_aggregate (kg/m³) :-	Large-sized aggregate (gravel/stones) that provides bulk and strength.
7. fine_aggregate (kg/m³) :- Small particles (sand) that fill gaps between coarse aggregates.
8. age (days) :- Number of days the concrete has been cured (e.g., 28, 90, 365 days).
9. concrete_compressive_strength (MPa) Target Variable :- The strength of concrete after curing, measured in Megapascals (MPa).

# Applications of the Project
- Construction Industry: Helps engineers design optimized concrete mixtures.
- Cost Reduction: Reduce excess use of cement while maintaining strength.
- Sustainability: Promotes the use of industrial byproducts like fly ash and slag.
- Quality Control: Predict compressive strength without destructive testing.
